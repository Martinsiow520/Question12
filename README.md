Describle the video segmentation 

Segmentation was applied in the video recognition process using the YOLACT approach. The trained weight used by the YOLACT was yolact resnet50 54 800000.pth, and it was applied to the COCO 2017 dataset. Through the Google Colaboratory, this process is quite quick and averages 27.1 frames per second. On the video, the subject was segmented and the appropriate label could be seen, however the segmentation's limitations were noted as not being continuously visible.
