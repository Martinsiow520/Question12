Describle the video segmentation 

Segmentation is applied during video recognition using the YOLACT method. The training weights used by YOLACT are yolact resnet50 54 800000.pth and applied to the COCO 2017 dataset. With Google Colaboratory, this process is very fast, averaging 27.1 frames per second. In the video, the subject is segmented and the appropriate labels can be seen, but the limitation of segmentation is pointed out that it cannot be continuously visible.
